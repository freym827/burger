# burger

This is a thrilling app that lets you keep track of burgers you wish to eat and 
burgers you have eaten.

It uses extensively database manipulation, sql, express, while using handlebars
for the page set up.

We used object-relational mapping for the set up of this app, as well as 
the Model-View-Controller framework.
